# Hi there, I'm Shria Singh 👋 

### 🧬 Maths & Computing Student | ✍️ Poet | 🧩 Cruciverbalist

I am a second-year B.Tech student at **IIT Guwahati** with a passion for learning about abstract mathematical tools and bridging them to the practical computational tools.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On
- **Quantitative Finance:** Exploring derivative pricing through my Financial Engineering coursework.
- **Numerical Optimisation:** Developing a library of solvers for root-finding and numerical integration.
- **AI & Data Science:** Building neural architectures from scratch to understand the calculus of learning.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), C++, SQL.
- **Mathematics:** Linear Algebra (SVD, Eigen-decomposition), Calculus (Optimisation, Gradient Descent), Discrete Math.
- **Tools:** Git/GitHub, LaTeX, VS Code.

### 🖋️ Beyond the Code
When I'm not solving systems of equations, you'll find me:
- **Writing Poetry:** Playing with words, verses and rhymes as much as I can, with a book under construction. 
- **Solving Cryptic Crosswords:** I enjoy the pattern recognition and lateral thinking required to decode complex wordplay.
